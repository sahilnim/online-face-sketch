# online-face-sketch
online face sketch is a standalone application, allowing user to construct accurate composite face sketch using the predefined facial feature sets provided as tools that can be resized and repositioned as per requirement/described by the eye-witness. Moreover, the constructed composite face sketch can then be matched with the law enforcement departments database using deep learning and the speed and efficiency of cloud
infrastructure to identify and verify the criminal. The same process can even be done with the hand-drawn sketch making the application backward compatible with traditional approaches.
